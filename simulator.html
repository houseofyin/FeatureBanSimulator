<h1>FeatureBan Simulator</h1>
<p>This simulator serves two purposes.  One, it provides
a tool to explore possible outcomes if facilitators want
to alter any of the basic rules of the simulation.  Two, 
it can be used as part of debriefing the simulation,
by letting facilitators help participants explore alternate
scenarios that they didn't explore during the FeatureBan activity.</p1>

<p>To use, select the desired paramters.  The default parameters
are suitable for a baseline. Then click the Run Simulation button</p>

<p>The simulator will produce two results.  First it will calculate
the average lead time and average number of work items completed
across ALL of the simulations just executed.  It will also produce
a cumulative flow diagram of the LAST simulation as an illustration.<p>

 <label for="stages">Stages:</label>
  <input type="text" name="stages" id="stages" value="4">How many stages should be on the Kanban board.<br>
<label for="rounds">Rounds:</label>
  <input type="text" name="rounds" id="rounds" value="10">How many rounds of die-rolling should be included in each simulation.<br>
<label for="minimumToUnblock">Minimum to Succeed:</label>
  <input type="text" name="minimumToUnblock" id="minimumToUnblock" value="4">On a 6-sided die, on what value should be counted as a success result.  Lower than this is considered a block.  e.g. a 4 is a 50/50 split.<br>
<label for="workers">Workers:</label>
  <input type="text" name="workers" id="workers" value="5">How many people should be included in each simulation.<br>
<label for="workItemsPerWorker">Work Items per Workers:</label>
	<input type="text" name="workItemsPerWorker" id="workItemsPerWorker" value="10">This is used to determine how many simulated cards should be initialized.<br>
<label for="simulations">Number of Simulations:</label>
	<input type="text" name="simulations" id="simulations" value="100">How many times the simulation should be run.  If you are only interested in the cummulative flow diagram, 1 is sufficient.  The metrics stablize around 1000 simulations.<br>
<label for="wipLimits">WiPLimits (Comma Separated):</label>
	<input type="text" name="wipLimits" id="wipLimits" value="35,35">A comma separated list of WiP limits for all of the stages, except for the first and the last.  E.g. if there are 4 stages selected above, there should be two listed here.  The defaults are set to be high enough that there should be in practice no effective limits.<br>
<label for="collaboation">Use Team Collaboration to Optimize Order of Work:</label>
	<select  name="collaboation" id="collaboation" >
	   <option value="false">False</option>
	   <option value="true">True</option>
	</select>There are some differences in outcome based on how well the team works together.  You need to run with a large number of simulations to see the effect reliably.<br>
